## Features:

- Displaying all acounts and their levels
- A route to recache all accounts in a local database (WIP)
- Select a random account
- View all acounts with level less than 5
- Distributed database - [GUN](https://gun.eco)

Huge thanks to [Mark Nadal](https://github.com/amark) and [GUN](https://gun.eco) community for creating such an amazing database!

## How to use:

Clone the repo and install all dependencies:

`npm install`

If you want your own system, then just change `vime-accs` in Gun initialiser to whatever you want, or add your own relay peers!
